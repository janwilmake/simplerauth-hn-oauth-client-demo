This demonstrates use of https://github.com/janwilmake/hn-oauth-client-provider in an as minimal way as possible.

This works in localhost, but in production on a cloudflare worker you'll quickly get ratelimited, forbidding any login. Thus, unfortunatly, this concept won't work unless HN would whitelist me.

If you want HN OAuth with a script as simple as this, please tell HackerNews about this project (hn@ycombinator.com) and [reach out to me](https://x.com/janwilmake)
